A digital take on a classic board game.

All one needs to do is to run the code to play the game. Within a session, it will track your wins and losses (player guessing) and Mr Roboto's wins and losses (AI guessing).

Mr. Roboto isn't the smartest but he wins regularly. His brain still functions randomly.
NOTE: The program has a 'sleep' in it on line 119. Edit this if Roboto is taking too long to 'think'. I added this so that one could watch him eliminate possibilities. 

This was created for 'The Odin Project'
