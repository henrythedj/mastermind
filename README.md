A digital take on a classic board game.

All one needs to do is to run the code to play the game. Within a session, it will track your wins and losses (player guessing) and Mr Roboto's wins and losses (AI guessing).

Mr. Roboto isn't the smartest but he wins regularly. His brain still functions randomly.
